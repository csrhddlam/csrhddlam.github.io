I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Bloomberg Distinguished Professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Distinguished_Professorships) [Alan Yuille](https://cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/). I received M.S. in Electrical Engineering at [University of California, Los Angeles](http://www.ucla.edu/) in 2017 and B.S. in Information Engineering at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2015. I also spent wonderful summers at Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and TuSimple.

My research interests are computer vision and machine learning.
